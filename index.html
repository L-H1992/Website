	<h3><strong>Why web development?</strong></h3>
	<p>As a teenager I would spend my spare time creating websites. This deep interest lead me to achieve qualifications in tightly related subjects up until level 3. After this, life had different plans for me however photography was still a dominant passion during this time. During the 2020 pandemic lockdown, my life slowed down. Prior to this everyday had been 100mph and now it had skid to a complete halt. What this made me discover however, was that having all this free time to think, to just be; old interests and hobbies quickly started to fill up my time. It was not long before I was dipping my toes back into coding and taking a small mooc to refresh my already existing skills. Then I dove into an online web development bootcamp. It began to take up all of my time! I spent hours studying even through until night.. I love the challenge of working out why a code is not working! Or why it is working, for that matter. Then get so giddy when something works =)

<div class="what">
	<h3><strong>What am I currently working on?</strong></h3>
	<p>Currently I am using my spare time to create a few little projects:</p>
	<ol>	<p><li>A dynamic website that contains a landing page and incorporates databases allowing for users to sign up, login, upload data (that is then stored in a database using <strong>Mongoose</strong>. The website contains middleware allowing for extra security of the data; for example, only a user who created a post will be allowed to delete or edit the information. To create a better UI and add design to the website I used <strong>Bootstrap</strong>.
My project still needs to be accessible to others and I have chosen to use the cloud program <strong>Heroku</strong> to make this possible as at the moment I have been creating the site with <strong>Goorm</strong> and must manually set the server running each time.</li></p>

	<p><li>A small interactive game where users match the colour of the square with the colour chosen at random by the code, created using <strong>Javascript</strong>. You can find this in the code pen <a href="https://cdpn.io/LifeofLeanne/debug/vYKBjNw/PBkNWnVobvvM">here <i class="fab fa-codepen"></i></a></li></p></ol>
